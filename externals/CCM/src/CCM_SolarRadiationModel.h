/*! A calculation class to compute the solar radiation on a given surface near the observer (building).

	The class utilizes the functionality of the ClimateDataLoader and SunPosition. These members
	have to be initialized correctly before using the SolarRadiationModel.

	The class computes short wave radiation loads (direct and diffuse) normal to the surface. Also,
	the incidence angle is computed as angle between the surface's normal and the sun's normal.

	Primary access function is setTime(), which takes the local time (in the time zone) of the
	observer and updates all computed quantities to this time point. Indirectly, the states of the
	members m_sunPositionModel and m_climateDataLoader are also updated. The time correction
	(local time to apparent solar time) for the sun position model is done automatically within
	the setTime() function.
