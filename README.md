# OpenHAM Releases #

OpenHAM is a console application and does not require an installer. Simply extract the archives
into some subdirectory and run the solver.

You may want to use the `--help` command line argument to see available options:


`OpenHAMSolver --help`


Please post bugs/feature requests via the ticket system.

## Linux Release Notes ##

The Linux binary was compiled on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS and requires the usual C/C++/GCC libraries.
On different Linux distros, simply recompile the solver - it does not have any dependencies
beside the usual *built-essentials* package.
