# OpenHAM

OpenHAM is an open-source Heat, Air and Moisture transport model, initially written by *Andreas Nicolai (andreas.nicolai -at- tu-dresden.de)*. 
It is meant as an **open source reference implementation** of the governing equations that are standardized, for example, in the HAMSTAD modeling document and the EN 15026 standard. It is specialized for 1D geometries and includes an automated grid generation algorithm.

See [OpenHAM-wiki](../../wiki) for details.
